Data files are stored across various git spaces. 

Some of the data I used is stored in this repository soley because I do not know where it lives, specifically the weekend source scan. 

Analog files:
All analog files can be found in the analog gitlab repo. The files I am using specifically are:
chip602_DigitalPaired-0_Americium-241_90min.h5py
chip602_DigitalPaired-0_Barium-133_180min.h5py

As for digital, those spectra were taken using the old codebase so they live in amanda's repo. 

The files I used were:
chip602_Barium-133_180min_pix00_100mV_beamDigital_20220713-101351.csv
chip602_Americium-241_90min_pix00_100mV_beamDigital_20220713-134207.csv

Power supply and digital weekend source scan data live in Amanda's repository in the directory
GSFCdataFromAutumnsScripts/biasscan_weekend_7-15/
